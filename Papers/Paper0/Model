The main idea of this work is based on embedding feature selection and spatio-temporal semi-supervised learning simultaneously in different layers of the deep learning net-
work. Considering the topics of interpolation and prediction both as the classification problem with different outputs, we use a general multiple-output classifier to solve the two
topics. In this paper we propose a novel deep learning network as the multiple-output classifier which utilizes the information pertaining to the unlabeled spatio-temporal
data not only to achieve the purpose of interpolation, but also to improve the performance of the prediction. Further,the main relevant features to the variation of the air quality
can also be revealed by embedding feature selection and performing association analysis in the proposed framework.We begin with describing the data representations and
symbols used in this work, then introduce the method to embed feature selection in the neural network.
