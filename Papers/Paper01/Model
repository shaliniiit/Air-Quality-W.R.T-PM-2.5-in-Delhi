We propose a co-training-based semi-supervised learning approach, which leverages unlabeled data to improve the inference accuracy. Additionally, the approach consists of
two classifiers respectively modeling the spatial and temporal factors that influence air qualities.We identify spatially-related (such as POIs, road networks,
and distance to an existing station) and temporally-related features (e.g., humidity, temperature, and traffic flow),contributing to not only our application but also the general
problem of air quality inference. Moreover, instead oftreating these features equally, we feed them into the corresponding classifier in the co-training framework,
therefore, leading to a high inference accuracy.We evaluated our approach using 5 data sources consisting of the POIs, road networks, meteorological data, and air
quality records of Beijing and Shanghai, and the GPS trajectories generated by over 30,000 taxis in Beijing,justifying the advantages of our approach over 4 baselines.
